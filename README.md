### Only HTML website

Create an HTML website about yourself or a topic that you are familiar with.

- The site must have at least two pages
- Indentation must be consistent (1 tab for each child element, just like ruby)
- Name the file of the main page for the site `index.html`, other file names should indicate what the file is about.
- Properly use all of the following tags to create structured and meaningful content:

-------

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<body>`
- `<p>`
- `<strong>`
- `<em>`
- `<img>`
- `<a>`
- `<div>`
- `<ul>`
- `<ol>`
  - `<li>`
- `<table>`
  - `<tr>`
    - `<th>`
    - `<td>`
- `<footer>`
- `<article>`
